 HackMIT 2020: 

The best way to learn is to practice. Notest allows users to create their own notes in an organized hierarchy, and then automatically generate personalized tests from them. Students worried about not having enough resources to do well on a test can prepare just by creating their own practice. Notest opens up the ability to have flexible notes available anywhere, send notes to peers if they missed a class, and to ace tests and quizzes by creating your own version of them. Each note consists of sections, which can have their own unique terms with definitions, examples, and practice questions, which can be used for Notest to create a test.
